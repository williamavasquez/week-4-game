	<h1> Crystals Collector!</h1>

	<p> You will be shown a random number at the start of the game.</br>
	When you click on a crystal it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
The player wins the game if their total score matches the random number and the player loses the game if their total score goes above the random number.
The amount of points each crystal adds is not shown to the player, but their total score is displayed and updated after each crystal is clicked.
The number of games won and lost will be displayed.
If the player successfully matches their total score to the random number they get 1 win, if the player's total score is above the random number the player get 1 loss, either way the game restarts.
When the game is restarted, the player will be shown a new random number, all the crystals will now have 4 different hidden values, and the player's total score is reset to 0.</p>
